I need to refresh reStructuredText syntax
=========================================

Sections?
---------

Similar to SETEXT syntax, except that there isn't predefined mapping between underline character and section level

Heading level 3
+++++++++++++++

Some paragraph level text

Yet another heading level 2
---------------------------

Wonder what bulleted lists look like?

* A list item
* Another list item
